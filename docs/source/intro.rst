Introduction
=============

.. hint::
    This is CxxBuild project, an easy generator of C++ build files with dependencies
    on CMake (and Bazel, hopefully).
    Please see `CxxBuild on GitHub <https://github.com/manydeps/cxxbuild>`_


CxxBuild is a tool for generating C++ build files with dependencies, designed for CMake
and other promising modern build systems, such as Bazel (not supported yet, but planned!).
It is written in python, meant to simplify the life of basic users and also for advanced users.
This is not a replacement of build systems, but a simplification to make it easier to start and
integrate a project with dependencies, in a format named cxxdeps.
