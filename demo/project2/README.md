## Demo/Project2

This project demonstrates how a very simple project, with a main() on `demo2.cpp`, and two more files `something.h` and `something.cpp`, all hosted on folder `src/`, is very easy to build.

Just type: `python3 cxxbuild.py`

Output will be built on `build/demo2`

The file `CMakeLists.txt` will be generated automatically.
 
No more extra dependencies are provided in this example.
